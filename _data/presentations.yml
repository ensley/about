# Academic Papers and Presentations
- event: Joint Statistics Meetings
  location: Baltimore, MD
  date: 31 Jul 2017
  advisor: Dr. Ben Shaby, Pennsylvania State University
  description: <em>Bayesian semiparametric covariance function estimation for stationary Gaussian processes by overwhelming force.</em> Presentation based on graduate research focusing on spatial statistics. Estimating covariance functions of stationary Gaussian processes in a fully Bayesian framework. While computation costs of the algorithm can be high, they are alleviated by parallelization on a GPU.
